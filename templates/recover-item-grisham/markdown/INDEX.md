In [TOWN.NAME], a fresh batch of bounties and quests have been pegged to the bulletin board.

While most of the requests are mundane tasks, one flyer stands out amongst the rest.

“A [_ITEMNAME] is wanted henceforth a bounty has been placed for the retrieval of [_ITEMNAME]. The last known location of [_ITEMNAME] was the [ITEM_LOCATION.NAME].”

While those that have placed the bounty don’t expect foul play, one can never be too careful about these types of things.
