Setting off toward [ITEM_LOCATION.NAME] is uneventful at first. The road is boring but free of troubles, which is a good thing in this line of work. Questing is hard enough and if the work can be done without bodily harm, the better.

One of them speaks, “You aren’t the first to look for [_ITEMNAME].”

“Indeed, you are not,” says a second one. 

“But perhaps, you can be the last. Take this,” says the third one.
